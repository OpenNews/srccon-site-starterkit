## SRCCON site starterkit

This is a generic version of a SRCCON website. Copy these directories and files into a new repositiory and customize them to create a new conference website.

### What's in srccon-site-starterkit:
* directories
	* _config: The config files that Travis will use to push updates to the staging and production sites. These files should be good to go, no updates necessary.
	* _includes: Partial templates used for different pieces of SRCCON site pages.
	* layouts: Primary templates for pages on the SRCCON site. The `layout.html` template includes header photos (e.g. https://2019.srccon.org). The `simple_layout.html` template does not have header photos (e.g. https://product.srccon.org)
	* media: Static CSS, JS, and img assets needed for the SRCCON site.
* pages
	* homepage
	* code of conduct
	* scholarships
	* volunteers
	* sponsorships

### Things that *should be done* before launching:
* templates
	* _config.yml
		* under `defaults`, the value for `title` is used for the <title> tag on most pages. It should include the conference name, date, and location. E.g. "SRCCON:PRODUCT 2020 â€” February 8, Philadelphia"
	* .travis.yml
		* the value for `notifications.slack.rooms.secure` should be updated. The new value can be generated by the Travis website when the new project is added.

### Things that *may need to be done* before launching:
* templates
	* _config.yml
		* under `defaults`, the value for `description` is written for a midyear SRCCON. If the site is for a topical SRCCON, it should be changed accordingly.
* assets
	* in the `media/img/` directory, `srccon_logo_angle` and `srccon_logo_angle_75` are logos that can be used for a conference called "SRCCON." If you're creating a site for a topical SRCCON, you should create appropriate logo files (probably starting from [this Illustrator template](https://github.com/OpenNews/media-assets/blob/master/srccon/srccon_thematic_logo_template.ai).)
