[![The Data-Driven Reporting Project](/media/img/partners/ddrp_knightlab.png)](https://datadrivenreporting.medill.northwestern.edu/)

[The Data-Driven Reporting Project](https://datadrivenreporting.medill.northwestern.edu/) equips local news organizations and freelance journalists—especially those who serve local and underrepresented communities—with financial awards and additional resources to work on data- or document-driven investigative work. Learn more about [the program here](https://datadrivenreporting.medill.northwestern.edu/how-to-apply). The DDRP is based out of [Northwestern University Knight Lab](https://knightlab.northwestern.edu/) at [Medill](https://medill.northwestern.edu/) and was founded with support from the [Google News Initiative](https://newsinitiative.withgoogle.com/).
