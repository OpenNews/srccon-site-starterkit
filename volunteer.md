# Volunteer at a SRCCON event {#volunteer}

We need YOU to help make each SRCCON work. In addition to participants leading sessions throughout our conferences, we also need a small group of people to help us keep things running smoothly. Want to help? Consider volunteering.

Volunteers will help with:

- Registration
- Supporting session leaders
- Set-up and clean-up
- Unexpected tasks that always come up during an event

Volunteering will be a significant time commitment. For offering that time and missing out on some (but not all!) of the festivities, you will have our gratitude, free entry to the event, a SRCCON Volunteer T-shirt, and the knowledge that you played an integral role in making SRCCON a success.

If you want to attend {{ page.event_name }} and are excited about playing this type of vital support role, [please email us for information](mailto:srccon@opennews.org) about volunteering.
