### Let's build SRCCON together

# Join us at {{ page.event_name }}! {#join}

{% if page.session_deadline_passed == false %}
**Our [call for participation form](/participation/form/) is open** and includes questions to tell us about all the ways you might want to participate at {{ page.event_name }}, including as an attendee or a session facilitator. We will review entries and notify everyone before or on {{ page.session_confirm }}. If invited to attend or facilitate a session, you will receive a link to purchase a ticket with [prices starting at {{ page.price_base }} plus fees](/attendees/#tickets).
{% endif %}

**SRCCON sessions are workshops, not panels. Conversations, not presentations.** This is a hands-on event about changing journalism&mdash;we're looking for [topics you don't see at traditional conferences](/sessions/proposal-guide/#what-we-look-for) and sessions that help people imagine a better future together. Our whole program (including breaks and meals!) is about discussion and connection as peers. If you haven't led a session like that before, our [proposal guide](/sessions/proposal-guide/) is here to help (and [so are we](mailto:srccon@opennews.org)).

{% if page.session_deadline_passed == true %}
Our deadline for proposing sessions has already passed, but we'll keep our [call for participation form](/participation/form) open for attendees as long as we have space!{% endif %}

### Key dates {#dates}

{% if page.session_deadline_passed == false %}* **[NOW](/participation/form)**: Call for participation is open!{% endif %}
* **{{ page.session_deadline }}**: Deadline to submit session proposals and stipend applications
* **Through {{ page.session_confirm }}**: We'll send out notifications about session proposals and stipend applications
* **After {{ page.session_confirm }}**: We'll review more participation forms for attendees only, on a rolling basis until the conference
* **{{ page.event_date }}**: {{ page.event_name }} in {{ page.event_place }}!

Curious about how it all works? Learn more about [being a participant at SRCCON](/attendees) and [our call for participation form](/participation/form). There won't be a separate ticket lottery or sale date, so if you want to come to {{ page.event_name }}, our call for participation is how to let us know!

### When & where {#when-where}

On {{ page.event_date }} in {{ page.event_place }}, SRCCON returns to [{{ page.event_venue}}]({{ page.event_venue_link }}). When tickets go on sale, we'll also open up a discounted block of rooms for participants at a nearby hotel.

{% comment %}<!-- remove to add -->
We have reserved a block of rooms at the [hotel](#TK) at a base rate of $### per night. The room-discount hotel is located steps away from the {{ page.event_venue }}. The reserved block of rooms will be available until {{ page.event_name }} starts or all rooms are booked, whichever happens first&mdash;booking early is always a good idea!
{% endcomment %}<!-- remove to add -->

### Health policy

We want everyone who comes to SRCCON to feel safe and cared for. We know that encouraging sensible precautions makes it possible for more members of our community to attend. We've kept an eye on journalism events since we last convened, and we’re seeing that it’s possible to come together in a group as long as we’re all doing our best to look out for others.
	
We will not require masking at {{ page.event_name }}, but some people may be masking, and we ask participants to respect anyone wearing a mask, particularly in session spaces where people are gathering more closely together. We will have masks available, but we invite you to bring your preferred N95, KN95, or similar masks as well. We also strongly encourage attendees to be up to date on their vaccinations and to please consider staying home if you’re not feeling well. If you have any questions or need further information, [reach out to us](mailto:srccon@opennews.org). Thanks for taking care of each other at SRCCON!

### What you can expect at {{ page.event_name }}

The SRCCON program is focused on the practical challenges that news technology and data teams encounter every day. 

At SRCCON, you’ll:

* Be part of hands-on workshops that reimagine newsroom tech, teamwork, leadership, community, and journalism itself&mdash;not panels where you sit back and listen, but sessions where you participate and learn.
* Connect with people who share your hopes and dreams for journalism&mdash;not just making professional acquaintances, but creating personal relationships that last.
* Bring who you are into a conference that thinks about the program, the schedule&mdash;even games & meals&mdash;as ways to celebrate everything you have to share.

SRCCON events are highly participatory, where participants come first so they can feel comfortable digging into complex problems. The conversations that happen here come from the community and reflect its values:

* **We lead change**&mdash;by challenging the power structures that have failed our industry, we push for long-lasting change in our organizations, led by journalists of color and journalists in local and regional newsrooms.
* **We support one another**&mdash;by offering each other our expertise and empathy, we find new collaborators, help each other learn, and make our networks and organizations more resilient.
* **We experiment in the open**&mdash;by sharing our work and processes, we do the transformative work our organizations need to better connect with and inform our communities.

### Who attends SRCCON events

Our participants represent organizations ranging from massive to tiny, and come from all over the U.S. and many other countries. SRCCON participants are developers, designers, journalists, editors, and allies: the practitioners and leaders who are transforming their newsrooms into more representative and innovative places to work. Participants come to SRCCON to change journalism by creating more intentional processes, better relationships with the communities they cover, and new ways to engage and inform people.

### How much does it cost?

[Ticket prices start at {{ page.price_base }}](/attendees/#tickets), plus ticketing fees. We'll also offer a limited number of need-based, [free scholarship tickets as well as {{ page.price_stipend }} travel or caregiving stipends](/scholarships).
