### When & where

**DATE, at VENUE in CITY**

### About {{ page.event_name }}

SRCCON events are highly participatory and inclusive, where participants come first so they can can feel comfortable digging into complex problems. We organize the schedule around hands-on sessions, conversations, and workshops focused on the practical challenges that news technology and data teams encounter every day.

Session topics come from the community and reflect its values:

* **We experiment in the open**—by sharing our work and processes, we do the transformative work our organizations need to better connect with and inform our communities.
* **We support one another**—by offering each other our expertise and empathy, we find new collaborators, help each other learn, and make our networks and organizations more resilient.
* **We lead change**—by challenging the power structures that have failed our industry, we push for inclusive, long-lasting change in our organizations, led by journalists of color and journalists in local and regional newsrooms.

### Who attends SRCCON events

The majority of SRCCON participants are the developers, designers, journalists, and editors who collaborate on open technologies and processes within journalism. Participants come to SRCCON because they are working to change journalism for the better, whether that be pushing for more inclusive processes, bringing outside technical perspectives into the newsroom, or developing new ways to engage and inform readers.

Our participants represent organizations ranging from massive to tiny, and come from all over the US and many other countries. Each year, we particularly welcome journalists and allies from the city hosting SRCCON, and we offer [live session transcripts and tons of documentation](https://2019.srccon.org/documentation/) for those who can't attend in person.
